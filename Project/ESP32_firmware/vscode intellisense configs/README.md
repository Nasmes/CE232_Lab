# VSCode Intellisense support
If you are using vscode with ESP-IDF plugin, you can rename this folder to `.vscode` to help intellisense find libraries.
Should tremendously help with coding, especially for learners who dig through things to understand functionalities.
At time of writing, I was using `vscode 1.90.0` and `esp-idf 5.2`.
